Team Project: IoT Car 
Production Part
 1) Auto Window System
    This window detects the car’s atmosphere whether there are dust and gas. If dust and gas amount become increasing, which makes the car’s inner part uncomfortable, the window are opened automatically. Plus, RGB      LED will be turn on to inform the atmosphere is bad. Users can modulate how much they will open the window. Also. They can operate ‘safety mode’. On the safety mode, if someone’s body part comes out the window,      then the buzzer goes off. This mode is useful when a baby is in the car. Buzzer makes parents notice that the baby is in danger.
 2) Temperature System
    On winter or summer, the inner of car would be so cold or hot, which makes the user uncomfortable. By using this function, the car sets the proper temperature before users take the car and during driving the        car. First of all, before taking the car, users can modulate the temperature of the car’s inner. You can set the preference temperature in the application and announce the time when you take the car. According       to the date in application, the car’s sensor and activator modulate the temperature. While you drive the car, the car always detects the temperature to modulate it automatically. You don’t have to consider the       temperature.
